This program uses the Quine McCluskey method to simplify
boolean functions. I created this program to simplify my
circuit logic for my Digital Logic Class, therefore the
actual code is not very well written. If you find any bugs
please report them to me - stefan (at) cooper (dot) edu.

This program was compiled on a mac - OSX Tiger.

to compile using g++, simply:
g++ qmcs.cc -o qmcs

to use the program without having to be in the same directory
copy the compiled binary to a folder in your PATH (e.g. /usr/bin)
